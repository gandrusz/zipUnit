{"name":"Zipunit","tagline":"Library for unit tests involving zip files and/or folder structure comparisons","body":"ZipUnit is a little library for comparing zip files as part of integration tests. Usage:\r\n\r\n`AssertThat.ZipFile(\"actual.zip\").MatchesZipFile(\"expected.zip\");`\r\n\r\nIt is possible to ignore additional or missing files:\r\n\r\n`AssertThat.ZipFile(\"actual.zip\").IgnoringAdditional(pattern1).IgnoringMissing(pattern2).MatchesZipFile(\"expected.zip\");`\r\n\r\nwhere patterns look like the following:\r\n\r\n`\"Dir/file.ext\" //starts from the root of the zip file`\r\n\r\n`\"//Dir/file.ext\" //starts from anywhere, like in an xPath`\r\n\r\n`\"Dir/*/file.ext\" //Asterix (*) matches any substring (excluding the slash '/')`\r\n\r\n`\"Dir/file?.ext\" //Question mark (?) matches one character (excluding the slash '/')`","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
